# Python-Office
This repository will store small projects using python. 

In this branch, I will upload some data structure achievement using Python. Also simple Algorithm will be shown here.

## Content
- [0-Git](https://github.com/JinkaiGUAN/Python-Office/tree/DataStructure/0-Git): This folder store some widely used `git` command. 

- [1-Stack_Queues_Deques](https://github.com/JinkaiGUAN/Python-Office/tree/DataStructure/1-Stack_Queues_Deques): The basic data structure achieved in this folder are as follows:
  - stacks: This folder achieved LIFO(last input first output) stacks. Now it only has array-based one.
  - queues: This folder achieved FIFO(first input first output) stacks. Noe it only has array-based one.

  - dequeï¼š We won't achieve this basic data structure since its a built-in data structure. you can use the following code to get it in Python
  
  ```python
  from collections import deque
  ```
- [2-LinkedList](https://github.com/JinkaiGUAN/Python-Office/tree/DataStructure/2-LinkedList): We are going to use linked list to build other kinds of data structure. The content are as follows,
  - singly_linkedlist: We achieved stack and queue using singly likedlist, which the time complexity in the wrost case can be `O(1)`, and the space complexity is `O(n)`, where n is the number of elements that the data structure stores.
